# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System
## 📌 Project Snapshot
A machine learning system that predicts a student’s math score (academic performance) using regression models.

🔍 The system analyzes multiple factors:
* 👤 Gender 
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Ethnicity 
* 🎓 Parental Education 
* 🍴 Lunch Type
* 📘 Reading 
* ✍️ Writing 
* 📚 Prep Course

The goal is to build a robust regression pipeline that can generalize well and provide accurate predictions of a student's math score (or overall academic performance).

The project includes: ✅ **Multiple regression algorithms** (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.) ✅ **ML Pipelines** for preprocessing + modeling ✅ **Flask web application** for user interaction ✅ **Dockerized Deployment** for Run anywhere with a single container.
